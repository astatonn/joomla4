COM_AKEEBABACKUP_SCHEDULE_LBL_CHECKHEADERINFO="<p>When a scheduled backup fails it typically means that PHP stopped working before the backup is complete. Therefore Akeeba Backup cannot notify you of the backup failure in the same way it notifies you for the backup finishing successfully or with warnings.</p><p>To solve that problem you can schedule the latest backup checks to run after the expected end of your backup run. Not sure when would that be? Ideally, it should be the length of the last successful backup recorded in the Manage Backups page plus half an hour.</p><p>You can schedule this check with many different methods, just like the backup itself. Below you will find more information about each scheduling method available for backup checks. If you are unsure which one to use we recommend that you use the same scheduling method as your backups.</p>"
